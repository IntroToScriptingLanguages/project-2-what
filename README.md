Here, you're basically helping the computer taking turns to write an essay.  The computer writes one word, you write the next and so on.

During your turn, you get a prompt telling you what type of words to write.  For instance, "Give me something you like" prompts for a noun, "give me something that you do to something else" prompts for an action verb, and so on.

The computer, on the other hand, randomly chooses words and phrases from a small dictionary pool of over 100 words.

Punctuation is automatically added, each essay is divided into paragraphs on 3-6 sentences each.

			<h1>Going to the Internship Fair</h1>
			<p>
     I'd never thought I'd have the courage to go to the internship fair, but, before I knew it, my second year at Bradley slammed into me like a runaway car.  Most of my friends already had internships and work in their fields of study.  Meanwhile, I could barely do chores without messing up, let alone hold down an actual job.  I realized that if I wanted to do something with my life, I'd have to change.
     <br><br>I remember walking into the foyer of the Renaissance Colosseum that fateful day.  Everywhere I looked were people in business suits, carrying shiny briefcases, their faces glowing with the confidence of corporate executives.  I felt sick to my stomach, unsure if the feeling was courage, nervousness, or dread. It was like staring into the face of a titan that was about to grab me up in and eat me.  I was surrounded by people who were better than me in every way, and yet, they were my competition, my opponents, my enemies.
     <br><br>When I entered the arena, a thousand thoughts poured into my head about my profile, my projects, the employers and what the companies did.  I wanted to just close my eyes, tune them out, and go into my happy place. When I walked up to the first employer, I could barely say my class year and degree.  My mind went blank, my introduction collapsed before it even got off the ground.  The man bombarded me with questions: "What languages do you know?  Do you have any work experience?  Describe to me a project you did in Java."  My thoughts flowed through my mind like a waterfall, and I just couldn't keep up with them.
     <br><br>When it was over, I wanted to throw up.  I just wanted to run out that door and never come back again.  A voice screamed in the back of my head: "You're a sophomore and you can't even design a webpage! If you can't get a little internship, Microsoft and Google would never hire you.  You're a failure as a computer scient-"
     <br><br>The voice abruptly stopped, just as a hand landed on my shoulder.
